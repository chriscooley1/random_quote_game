# random_quote_game
I want to create a game where the users will receive a quote and they will have a time limit to answer where the quote is from. There may be different game modes where it'll be like Catch Phrase and once you answer, you pass it off to the other team, but they only have the remaining time from the counter to answer. Whichever team is on the quote when the time is up, the opposite team will receive a point. The other game mode would be guess as many quotes as you can until the timer runs out. Then after a certain amount of rounds, you'll add all the points up to see who is the winner.
